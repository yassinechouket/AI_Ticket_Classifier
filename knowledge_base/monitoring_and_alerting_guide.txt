MONITORING AND ALERTING GUIDE
==============================

Complete guide for setting up and troubleshooting monitoring systems and alerts.

SYSTEM MONITORING SETUP
------------------------

New Monitoring Requirements (Priority P3):
- Identify critical metrics to monitor
- Select appropriate monitoring tool (Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch)
- Configure alert thresholds
- Set up notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Test alert delivery
- Document alert runbooks
- Schedule review meetings

Monitoring Dashboard Configuration (Priority P3):
- Create custom dashboards for key services
- Configure widget types (graphs, tables, gauges)
- Set up time ranges and refresh intervals
- Add annotations for deployments
- Share dashboards with team
- Set up dashboard permissions

METRIC COLLECTION ISSUES
------------------------

Metrics Not Appearing (Priority P2):
- Verify agent/service is running
- Check network connectivity to monitoring service
- Review agent configuration files
- Verify API keys and authentication
- Check firewall rules for monitoring ports
- Review agent logs for errors
- Test metric push manually
- Escalate to DevOps team if unresolved

High Metric Cardinality (Priority P2):
- Identify high-cardinality tags
- Review tag usage and necessity
- Optimize tag values (avoid timestamps, IDs)
- Consider metric aggregation
- Check for tag explosion
- Optimize metric naming conventions
- Review with monitoring team

ALERT CONFIGURATION
-------------------

Alert Not Firing (Priority P2):
- Verify alert threshold configuration
- Check metric name and tags match exactly
- Review alert evaluation window
- Test alert condition manually
- Verify alert is enabled (not muted)
- Check notification channel configuration
- Review alert history for past triggers

Alert Noise / False Positives (Priority P3):
- Review alert thresholds (may be too sensitive)
- Adjust evaluation window
- Add alert conditions or filters
- Implement alert fatigue reduction
- Review alert patterns and trends
- Consider alert grouping/batching
- Schedule alert review meeting

ALERT RESPONSE
--------------

On-Call Rotation Setup (Priority P3):
- Define on-call schedule
- Configure escalation policies
- Set up PagerDuty or similar tool
- Test on-call notifications
- Document on-call procedures
- Train team on incident response
- Review and update rotations regularly

Alert Escalation Issues (Priority P2):
- Verify escalation chain is configured
- Check notification channel status
- Review escalation timing settings
- Test escalation path manually
- Verify on-call person availability
- Check for alert fatigue causing missed escalations

MONITORING PERFORMANCE
---------------------

Monitoring System Slow (Priority P2):
- Check monitoring service status page
- Review query performance
- Optimize dashboard queries
- Reduce time range for heavy queries
- Check for rate limiting
- Review metric retention policies
- Consider upgrading monitoring plan

High Monitoring Costs (Priority P3):
- Review metric retention policies
- Identify unused metrics
- Optimize metric cardinality
- Review custom metrics usage
- Check for duplicate metrics
- Consider metric sampling
- Schedule cost review meeting
