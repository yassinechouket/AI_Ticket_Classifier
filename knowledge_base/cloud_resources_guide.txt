CLOUD RESOURCES MANAGEMENT GUIDE
==================================

This document provides guidance for managing cloud resources and troubleshooting cloud-related issues.

AWS EC2 INSTANCE MANAGEMENT
---------------------------

Starting Instances (Priority P3):
- Verify instance type matches requirements
- Check security group configurations
- Ensure proper IAM roles are attached
- Review instance tags for cost allocation
- Confirm network access rules

Stopping Instances (Priority P3):
- Verify no critical workloads are running
- Check for attached EBS volumes
- Review auto-scaling group configurations
- Confirm backup schedules are complete
- Document reason for stopping

Instance Scaling (Priority P2):
- Monitor CPU and memory utilization
- Review CloudWatch metrics
- Calculate optimal instance size
- Test scaling in staging environment
- Update auto-scaling policies
- Notify affected teams before scaling

AZURE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
-------------------------

Resource Group Organization (Priority P3):
- Group related resources together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Apply tags for cost tracking
- Review resource dependencies
- Document resource purposes

Virtual Machine Operations (Priority P2):
- Verify VM size meets requirements
- Check disk configurations
- Review network security groups
- Confirm backup policies are active
- Monitor resource usage trends

Storage Account Management (Priority P2):
- Review access tiers (hot/cool/archive)
- Monitor storage costs
- Check replication settings
- Verify encryption configurations
- Review access policies

CLOUD COST OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------

Right-Sizing Resources (Priority P3):
- Analyze utilization metrics
- Identify underutilized instances
- Consider reserved instances for steady workloads
- Review storage tier configurations
- Implement auto-scaling policies

Cost Monitoring (Priority P3):
- Set up billing alerts
- Review cost allocation tags
- Analyze cost trends monthly
- Identify unexpected charges
- Optimize data transfer costs

RESOURCE CLEANUP PROCEDURES
---------------------------

Identifying Unused Resources (Priority P3):
- Review resource creation dates
- Check last access timestamps
- Verify with resource owners
- Document dependencies
- Create cleanup schedule

Safe Deletion Process (Priority P2):
- Backup important data
- Verify no active dependencies
- Get approval from resource owner
- Document deletion reason
- Monitor for 48 hours after deletion
