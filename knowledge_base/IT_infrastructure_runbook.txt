===========================================

SECTION 1: SERVER TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------

1.1 High CPU Usage
Priority: P1 (Critical if production server)
Affected Systems: Application servers, database servers
Resolution Steps:
- Check top processes using: top, htop, or ps aux
- Identify resource-intensive processes
- Review application logs for errors or infinite loops
- Check for scheduled jobs running simultaneously
- Consider scaling horizontally if legitimate load
- Average resolution time: 30 minutes
Escalation: Infrastructure team if hardware related

1.2 Memory Leaks
Priority: P2 (High if impacting performance)
Affected Systems: Application servers, Java/Node.js services
Resolution Steps:
- Monitor memory usage trends over time
- Check for OOM (Out of Memory) errors in logs
- Review recent code deployments
- Analyze heap dumps for Java applications
- Restart affected services as temporary fix
- Schedule application code review
- Average resolution time: 2 hours
Escalation: Development team for code fixes

1.3 Disk Space Issues
Priority: P1 (Critical if <10% remaining)
Affected Systems: All servers, databases, log servers
Resolution Steps:
- Identify large files/directories: du -sh /*
- Clean up old log files (>30 days)
- Archive or delete old backups
- Check for runaway processes creating temp files
- Expand disk space if consistently at capacity
- Average resolution time: 15 minutes
Escalation: System admin for disk expansion

SECTION 2: NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------

2.1 Connectivity Issues
Priority: P1 (Critical if affecting multiple users)
Affected Systems: Network infrastructure, VPN, firewalls
Resolution Steps:
- Test connectivity: ping, traceroute, telnet
- Check firewall rules and security groups
- Verify DNS resolution: nslookup, dig
- Review recent network changes
- Check for DDoS attacks or unusual traffic patterns
- Average resolution time: 45 minutes
Escalation: Network team for infrastructure issues

2.2 Slow Network Performance
Priority: P2 (High if business-critical applications affected)
Affected Systems: Network switches, routers, ISP connections
Resolution Steps:
- Run bandwidth tests from multiple locations
- Check for network congestion or packet loss
- Review Quality of Service (QoS) configurations
- Identify bandwidth-intensive applications
- Check for malware or unauthorized downloads
- Average resolution time: 1 hour
Escalation: Network team for capacity upgrades

2.3 VPN Connection Problems
Priority: P2 (High for remote workers)
Affected Systems: VPN concentrators, authentication servers
Resolution Steps:
- Verify user credentials and MFA tokens
- Check VPN client software version
- Review VPN server capacity and connections
- Test from different networks/locations
- Clear VPN client cache and reconnect
- Average resolution time: 20 minutes
Escalation: Security team for policy issues

SECTION 3: DATABASE TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------

3.1 Slow Query Performance
Priority: P2 (High if affecting user experience)
Affected Systems: Database servers, application databases
Resolution Steps:
- Identify slow queries using profiler/logs
- Check for missing indexes
- Review query execution plans
- Look for table locks or deadlocks
- Update database statistics
- Consider query optimization or caching
- Average resolution time: 1 hour
Escalation: DBA team for schema changes

3.2 Database Connection Issues
Priority: P1 (Critical if application down)
Affected Systems: Database servers, connection pools
Resolution Steps:
- Check database server status and logs
- Verify connection string configuration
- Review connection pool settings
- Check for max connections reached
- Test direct database connectivity
- Restart connection pool if necessary
- Average resolution time: 30 minutes
Escalation: DBA team for server issues

3.3 Database Backup Failures
Priority: P2 (High - data integrity risk)
Affected Systems: Backup servers, database servers
Resolution Steps:
- Review backup logs for error messages
- Check disk space on backup destination
- Verify backup job scheduling and permissions
- Test manual backup execution
- Validate existing backups are restorable
- Average resolution time: 45 minutes
Escalation: DBA team for backup strategy changes

SECTION 4: MONITORING & ALERTS
-------------------------------------------

4.1 False Positive Alerts
Priority: P3 (Medium - reduces alert fatigue)
Resolution Steps:
- Review alert thresholds and conditions
- Analyze historical data for patterns
- Adjust monitoring rules to reduce noise
- Document known acceptable conditions
- Update alert notification channels

4.2 Monitoring System Down
Priority: P1 (Critical - blind to issues)
Resolution Steps:
- Check monitoring agent status on servers
- Verify monitoring server connectivity
- Review monitoring service health
- Check for certificate expiration
- Restore from backup if system corrupted
- Average resolution time: 1 hour

SECTION 5: COMMON ERROR CODES
-------------------------------------------

HTTP 500: Internal Server Error
- Check application logs immediately
- Review recent deployments
- Verify database connectivity
- Check for configuration issues

HTTP 503: Service Unavailable
- Check if service is running
- Review resource utilization
- Check for maintenance mode enabled
- Verify load balancer health checks

Connection Timeout Errors
- Test network connectivity
- Check firewall rules
- Verify service is listening on correct port
- Review timeout configuration settings
